# Assets

Place your media assets here to be referenced from the root `README.md`.

Expected files:

- `logo.png` — Project logo shown at the top of the README.
- `demo.mp4` — Short screen recording demonstrating the bot (linked in the README).

Notes:

- Filenames are referenced exactly as above.
- Keep file sizes reasonable for Git.
- If you prefer a GIF for inline preview, you can also add `demo.gif` and update the README accordingly.
